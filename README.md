# Flipkart Clone 🛒

This is a simple Flipkart clone project that I built **from scratch** using **HTML and CSS** during my **internship in 2023**.

The goal was to replicate Flipkart’s product listing and detail page UI to improve my frontend development skills. While the project is **not fully responsive**, it reflects my self-driven learning approach — **no frameworks, templates, or AI assistance** were used.

📌 **Note**: This project was created purely for practice and skill enhancement.
